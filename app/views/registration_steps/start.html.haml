      %h4 WHAT IS THE METALS DIRECTORY?
      %p
        The Metals Directory is your year long go-to guide--a resource that uses Modern Metals and FFJournal magazines'
        combined circulation of service centers, fabricators and OEMs/end users. Published in June, The Metals Directory
        is distributed at major trade shows and meetings throughout the year. Update your listing as often as you want
        to take advantage of our newest product categories. For Metal Service Center registrants, your information will
        also be included in our printed Regional Metals Directories.
